Hello, and welcome to my IT tutorial on how to use the Jira Ticketing System! First off, we will begin by creating a ticket on the Jira platform. A ticketing system is responsible for mananging requests that a client or user puts in and the help desk team is obligated to assign the ticket, trouble shoot the issue, do technical documentation to better understand the issue, potentially escalate the ticket to more experienced team members if it is a severe issue or priority, finally you reach out to the client or user and close the ticket.

First things first, you must look up the Jira website on any browser of your choice. Once you make it to the landing page you must create and account to continue the tutorial. Once you make an account, you will be taken to the welcome screen with a bunch of tools and settings readily available to you. You will have to use the Jira Service Desk Management app in order to continue.

<p>
Once you create your account and make the necessary configurations. First you must press the blue create button, input the issue at hand in the summary section, input a due date *if necessary, specify the hardware or software issue in the component section, and further specify in detail what went wrong. Finally, go ahead and press "create" to create the ticket so you and the help desk team can resolve the issue.
