Hello, and welcome to my IT tutorial on how to use the Jira Ticketing System! First off, we will begin by creating a ticket on the Jira platform. A ticketing system is responsible for mananging requests that a client or user puts in and the help desk team is obligated to assign the ticket, trouble shoot the issue, do technical documentation to better understand the issue, potentially escalate the ticket to more experienced team members if it is a severe issue or priority, finally you reach out to the client or user and close the ticket.

First things first, you must look up the Jira website on any browser of your choice. Once you make it to the landing page you must create and account to continue the tutorial. Once you make an account, you will be taken to the welcome screen with a bunch of tools and settings readily available to you. You will have to use the Jira Service Desk Management app in order to continue.

Once you create your account and make the necessary configurations. First you must press the blue create button, input the issue at hand in the summary section, input a due date *if necessary, specify the hardware or software issue in the component section, and further specify in detail what went wrong. Finally, go ahead and press "create" to create the ticket so you and the help desk team can resolve the issue.

</p>
<p>
Once you complete the prior step, you have to write a detailed technical description of what the issue is, make note in case you tried to trouble shoot the issue and provide some more insight to the problem in order to solve the issue within the SLA requirements. Next you will specify who assinged the ticket under the "assignee" drop down menu. Lastly, you will need to click the drop down menu on the "priority" tab and decipher if it is a low, medium, or high issue and press "create" to create the ticket.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
While the ticket is in the pending phase, it would be ideal to notify the customer of the progress you have made so far or disclose if you fully resolved the issue at hand. Once you finish replying to the customer you will have to press the "pending" button in order to continue.

<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Next, you will proceed to the next step by clicking the "start progress-> work in progress" button. It is ideal to let the customer or client know that the trouble shooting phase is in progress. Once you notify the customer or client make sure to press "start progress"
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Next you will click the "mark as done" button press the "resolution" drop down menu and specify that the ticket is done. Next you will provide a detailed description about the progress you have made and specify if the issue is resolved.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
The significance of the prior steps is to ensure that you are in good standing, making updates, and having good communication with your help desk team and the customer/ client. Updating tickets is optional however, in the workplace you will be trained on how they prefer to assign, manage, and resolve tickets in a real world setting in order to meet SLA requirements.
